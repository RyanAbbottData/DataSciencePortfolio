# Data Science Portfolio
This is my data science portfolio. It contains all of the code used in the various analysis projects I have completed over time.
## Sports Analytics Projects 
This directory contains several sports data analytics projects I've worked on over the past year. Most of the work is done in R, except for some data collection for which R has limited facilities. This is done with Python. 
## COVID-19 Detection in Lungs
This project employs TensorFlow and a convolutional neural network. In this directory contains Python code that attempts to classify X-ray images of lungs as those afflicted by COVID-19, Pneumonia, or normal lungs. 
## Predicting Frequency of Crimes in Chicago
In this notebook, I attempt to generate a time-series regression model that predicts the frequency of theft, robbery, and burglary crimes occuring at residences in Chicago. 
## Determining the Spending Habits of Online Shoppers
In this notebook, I use Google Analytics from an online shop to build a classifier that predicts a customer's buying habits.
## Predicting NBA Teams' Wins in a Season
This R markdown file uses NBAStatR, a Basketball Reference API wrapper, to mine data and perform linear regression to predict the number of wins a team will record in a season.
