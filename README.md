# Data Science Portfolio
This is my data science portfolio. It contains all of the code used in the various analysis projects I have completed over time.
## NBA MVP Predictor 
This directory contains an R markdown file that predicts the Most Valuable Player of the current NBA season. Most of the work is done in R, except for some data collection for which R has limited facilities. This is done with Python. 
## COVID-19 Detection in Lungs
This project employs TensorFlow and a convolutional neural network. In this directory contains Python code that attempts to classify X-ray images of lungs as those afflicted by COVID-19, Pneumonia, or normal lungs. 
## Predicting Frequency of Crimes in Chicago
In this notebook, I attempt to generate a time-series regression model that predicts the frequency of theft, robbery, and burglary crimes occuring at residences in Chicago. The trend oscillates based on the time of year, so I develop a sinusoidal relation.
## Determining the Spending Habits of Online Shoppers
In this notebook, I use Google Analytics from an online shop to build a classifier that predicts a customer's buying habits. The quantity of data in each category (purchase, non-purchase) is quite imbalanced, so I also utilized oversampling to eliminate model bias.
## Predicting NBA Teams' Wins in a Season
This R markdown file uses NBAStatR, a Basketball Reference API wrapper, to mine data and perform linear regression to predict the number of wins a team will record in a season.
